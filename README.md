Thumb Album
===========

A digital photo album with tagging and searching intended to be kept on a thumb drive. 

Originally intended as a gift for my mother as a digital solution to bulky photo albums, 
Thumb Album allows users to save, search, and view hundreds of their HD photographs all 
off of a portable USB thumb drive.
